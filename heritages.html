<div style="font-family:arial; font-size:20px;text-align:justify; padding:10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.10);">
In a country like Nepal, national heritage sites draw a lot of tourists.
UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), whose aim is to preserve and promote these heritages all around the world,
 has researched on and selected some of the natural and cultural places of our country and included them in the list of world heritages sites. 
 These sites are: Kathmandu Durbar Square (Hanuman Dhoka), Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, Pashupatinath Temple, Swayambhunath Stupa, Bouddhanath, Lumbini, Changu Narayan Temple, Chitwan National Park and Sagarmatha National Park.
 Besides these there are lots of heritages sites in Nepal.
 <p style="font-family:arial; font-size:20px;text-align:justify;">Here are the world sites in details.</p>

	<img id="images" src="images/heritages/boudhanath.jpeg" align="center"vspace=5px >
	<p>
	
Boudhanath (Nepali: बौद्धनाथ, also called the Khāsa Caitya, Newari Khāsti, Standard Tibetan Jarung Khashor, Wylie: bya rung kha shor) is a stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal. Located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu, the stupa's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal.
The Buddhist stupa of Boudhanath dominates the skyline; it is one of the largest stupas in the world.

	<img id="images" src="images/heritages/swayambhunath.jpeg" align="center"vspace=5px >
	<p>
Swayambhunath (Devanagari: स्वयम्भू स्तूप; Nepal Bhasa: स्वयंभू; sometimes Swayambu or Swoyambhu) is an ancient religious architecture atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley, west of Kathmandu city. The Tibetan name for the site means 'Sublime Trees' (Wylie: Phags.pa Shing.kun), for the many varieties of trees found on the hill. However, Shing.kun may be a corruption of the local Nepal Bhasa name for the complex, Singgu, meaning 'self-sprung'	
The complex consists of a stupa, a variety of shrines and temples, some dating back to the Licchavi period. A Tibetan monastery, museum and library are more recent additions. The stupa has Buddha's eyes and eyebrows painted on. Between them, the number one (in Devanagari script) is painted in the fashion of a nose.

Lumbinī (Nepali and Sanskrit: लुम्बिनी , "the lovely") is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. 
It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Mayadevi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama in 563 BCE.
Gautama, who achieved Enlightenment some time around 528 BCE, became the Buddha and founded Buddhism.
Lumbini is one of many magnets for pilgrimage that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of the Buddha.
Lumbini has a number of temples, including the Mayadevi Temple and several others which are still under repair. Many monuments, monasteries and a museum, the Lumbini International Research Institute, are also within the holy site. 
Also there is the Puskarini, or Holy Pond, where the Buddha's mother took the ritual dip prior to his birth and where he had his first bath.
 At other sites near Lumbini, earlier Buddhas were, according to tradition, born, then achieved ultimate Enlightenment and finally relinquished their earthly forms.
